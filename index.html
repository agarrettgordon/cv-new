                <h2>Hello.</h2>
                <p class="intro">Many years ago, I ventured into the world of web development as a hobby and enjoyed it a great deal and went on to receive a certificate from the University of Washington. But, not knowing where to take the minimal skills learned or how to build upon those skills, led me to give up and head back into the world of clerical/administrative services.</p>

                    <h3>Administration & Bookkeeping</h3>
                    <p>The majority of my working experience is centered around administration and bookkeeping. I have been an Office Manager for a small construction company, a Bookkeeper for a large corporation as well as for a small start-up, and most recently a Fiscal Assistant for a school district.</p>

                    <h3>Information Technology</h3>
                    <p>In addition to administrative and fiscal work, I was the Help Desk Administrator for a large corporation, where I also did the tasks of the Network Administrator. These skills served me well when I was the only Information Systems person at a small hospital in Oklahoma.</p>
